# Clicky Game

##### What does the app do and why?
The goal of this app was to get better accustomed with using React by making a click games based on a variety of images. upon starting, you are presented a game where if you click a different image, your score goes up. If you click on an image already clicked on, you start over, although your highscore does transfer over.

##### How is this app organized?
Begining with create-react-app, the page was devided into seperate components each responsible for its own job. The navbar is in charge of keeping track of the score while the cards appear and rearrange themselves upon being clicked on.
